BloomPy
=======

A bloom filter implementation. Relies only on standard library modules. Is likely quite inefficient. The first area I'd visit to increase performance are the hash functions.

I wrote this mainly to teach myself about bit manipulation in Python. Comments/suggestions for style or idiomatic improvement welcome!
